/*
 * Shared Interrupts And Bottom Halves (workqueue solution)
 *
 * Write a module that shares its IRQ with your network card.  You can
 * generate some network interrupts either by browsing or pinging.
 *
 * Make it use a top half and a bottom half.
 *
 * Check /proc/interrupts while it is loaded.
 *
 * Have the module keep track of the number of times the interrupt's
 * halves are called.
 *
 * Implement the bottom half using:
 *
 * tasklets.
 *
 * work queues
 *
 * A background thread which you launch during the module's
 * initialization, which gets woken up anytime data is available.
 * Make sure you kill the thread when you unload the module, or it may
 * stay in a zombie state forever.
 *
 * For any method you use does, are the bottom and top halves called
 * an equal number of times?  If not why, and what can you do about
 * it?
 *
 * Note: the solutions introduce a delay parameter which can be set
 * when loading the module; this will introduce a delay of that many
 * milliseconds in the top half, which will provoke dropping even more
 * bottom halves, depending on the method used.x
