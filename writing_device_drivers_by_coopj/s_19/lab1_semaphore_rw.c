 *: Using Wait Queues  (R/W semaphore solution)
 *
 *  Generalize the previous character driver to use wait queues,
 *
 *  Have the read() function go to sleep until woken by a write()
 *  function.  (You could also try reversing read and write.)
 *
 *  You may want to open up two windows and read in one window and
 *  then write in the other window.
 *
 *  Try putting more than one process to sleep, i.e., run your test
 *  read program more than once simultaneously before running the
 *  write program to awaken them.  If you keep track of the pid's you
 *  should be able to detect in what order processes are woken.
 *
 *  There are several solutions given:
 *
 *      Using wait_event_interruptible().  You may want to use atomic
 *      functions for any global variables used in the logical
 *      condition.
 *
 *      Using wait_for_completion().
 *
 *      Using semaphores.
 *
 *      Using read/write semaphores.
 *
 *      Using exclusive waiting on the many readers solution..  How
 *      many processes wake up?
 *
 *  If you test with cat, echo, or dd, you may see different results
 *  than if you use the supplied simple read/write programs.  Why?
